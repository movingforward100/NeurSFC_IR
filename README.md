# Neural Space-filling Curves for Image  Restoration Tasks

Please refer to the official pytorch implementation (NeurSFC, ECCV 2022) for conda env development.

## Requirements

First, create a new virtual environment (conda). Then,

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Please follow https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ to install **pytorch** and https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notes/installation.html to install **torch_geometric** properly.

Our code is tested under **Python 3.9.13**, **pytorch 1.11.0**, **cuda 11.3**, and **torch_geometric(pyg) 2.0.4**.

Our specific installation follows:

```bash
cd path/to/project
conda create -n neuralsfc python=3.9.13
conda activate neuralsfc
pip install -r requirements.txt
conda install pytorch==1.11.0 torchvision==0.12.0 torchaudio==0.11.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
conda install pyg -c pyg
```

## Training  

### Step 1: Prepare Dataset

Tasks: 
  LLIE:
    LOLv1:
  Deblurring:
    GoPro: 
  SR:
    XXX:
  Dehazing:
    XXX


### Step 2: Pre-processing

- Calculate centroids: 
      - crop training images: run python preprocessing/crop.py;
      - centroids calculation: run python preprocessing/cal_centroid.py
- Set normalize_lo and normalize_hi for configuration file (necessary when e_class = 'lzwl')
      - run python preprocessing/cal_p5_p95.py --cfg configs/IR/xxx/xxx.yml
      - set normalize_lo and normalize_hi in configs/IR/xxx/xxx.yml; 

- Please note normalize_lo should be slightly lower than p5 and normalize_hi should be slightly higher than p95. I have done this part for GoPro and LOLv1 datasets.




To Terry: I need you to check: 

- Is there incorrect settings in .yml files?
- check data.pyï¼Œ model.py, and train.py under neuralsfc folder? Please note my plan is to do validations on test subset. In model.py, this version aims to work equally to the original repo.
- check utils/lzw.py. I did some changes here.
- run each .yml for several epoches (e.g., 3 epoches) to check if the output is as expected.
